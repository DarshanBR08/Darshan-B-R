## 🚀 How to Run the Code

You can run these programs using any Java IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code), or through the command line.

### 🔸 Common Steps for All Programs

1. Create a Java project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
2. Create a package named `Assignment`.
3. Create separate Java files inside the package with the following class names:
   - `Calculator.java`
   - `Program2.java`
   - `Program3.java`
   - `Problem4.java`
4. Paste the corresponding code into each file.
5. Right-click on the file and select **Run As > Java Application**.
6. Follow console instructions as required (like entering input).

### 📂 File List

- `Calculator.java` – Performs basic arithmetic operations.
- `Program2.java` – Generates the first `x` odd numbers (includes even/odd check).
- `Program3.java` – Optimized version for only odd input-based odd number generation.
- `Problem4.java` – Finds count of numbers that are divisible by [1-9] from an input array.

**Note**: Make sure your project is properly set up and the package `Assignment` is correctly defined in each file to avoid errors.
